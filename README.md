# ü®† SighApp

**SighApp** is an experimental fullstack application built as a personal learning project using **Go (Golang)** for the backend and **Vue.js** for the frontend.

This project serves as both a **boilerplate and playground**, designed with clean, maintainable architecture in mind ‚Äî following the **Vertical Slice Architecture** for backend development and modular principles on the frontend.
